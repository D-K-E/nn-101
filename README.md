Simple Introductions to Neural Networks from Scratch

The tutorials are designed for absolute beginners to machine learning.
I do not assume that you are experts in Python as well.
The code should be quite easy to read if you have any experience in C like
languages.
Lastly the tutorials assume that you are at least familiar with basic
operations of linear algebra, if you are not look up matrix multiplication
and arithmetic operations between a scalar and vector/matrix. All the rest is
introduced gradually in the tutorial.

# Dependencies

- `numpy` required for matrix operations

- `matplotlib`, optional, install it if you would like to see the plots.


Here is the list of current tutorials:

- [A Tiny Neuron is Born in a Cookie Night - 01](nn101/)

  Start with this one if you have absolutely no idea what neural networks are 
  or how they function. The math is introduced along with code, and
  everything advances in an incremental fashion. Once you are done with this
  you should have a fairly good idea about the structure of a neural network.
